# Project: Drawing Emojis with Multiple For Loops in p5.js

Use multiple `for` loops to draw emojis in different patterns on the screen.

## Requirements
Using 4 different 4 loops to do the following"
1. **Horizontal Line**:
   - Draw a line of emojis horizontally across the screen using a for loop.
2. **Vertical Line**:
   - Draw a line of emojis vertically down the screen using a for loop.
3. **Diagonal Line**:
   - Draw a line of emojis diagonally from one corner of the screen to the opposite corner using a for loop.
4. **Random Placement**:
   - Use a for loop to randomly place emojis at various positions on the screen.


## Experiments (not marked)
- Try making the font size change with every loop
- play with `frameRate()`
- make the background colour allways change 
- if you are brave try making a line that rotates
